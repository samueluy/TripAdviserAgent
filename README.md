## Task

Your task is to develop a Trip Adviser Agent (TAA) for Filipino travelers during the Covid pandemic for 
a country of your choice. All travelers will be coming from the Philippines and will be travelling to another 
country. Consider that there are many different kinds of travelers: citizen (for dual citizens), returning 
resident (a Filipino who holds a resident visa in another country, but not a citizen of that country), overseas 
Filipino worker, official business (traveling as function of oneâ€™s job), or as a tourist. Remember that 
travelers may also be of different ages.  <br/>
Prior to the pandemic, various travel documents are required from any traveler, such as a valid passport, 
visas (depending on the country, or the type of travel). Currently, there are additional requirements, such 
as a negative RT-PCR tests, vaccination cards, and so on.  <br/>
The traveler consults the Trip Adviser Agent. During this consultation, TAA asks questions about his 
profile, his travel party (if not traveling alone), and then a recommendation: if he (or his party) is allowed 
to travel, and if yes, what documents have to be prepared, including procedures to follow upon arrival in 
the country such as the quarantine period and other requirements. As part of the scope, only: (i) returning 
residents travel as a family, and (ii) tourists also travel as a family.  <br/>
TAA is a specialized agent, it can only advise the traveler based on one country.
